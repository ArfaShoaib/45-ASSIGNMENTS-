// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const vehicles : string[] = ["Kia Car", "BMW Car", "Audi"];

const mssg = "I would like to buy a";

for (let i= 0; i< vehicles.length; i++) {
     console.log(mssg+" "+vehicles[i]);
    
}
