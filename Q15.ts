// Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

// • Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

// • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

// • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.


// 1st step
let invites : string[] = ["Zoya","Zainab", "Fatima"];
console.log(invites);

// 2nd step
let cannotattend = "Zainab";
console.log(`\n"Unfortunately ${cannotattend} can not make it to party"\n`);


// 3rd step
let newguest = "Sara";
invites [invites.indexOf(cannotattend)] = newguest;

// 4th step
invites.map(($items) => 
      console.log(`${$items}`+" "+ `You Are Invited`)
)
