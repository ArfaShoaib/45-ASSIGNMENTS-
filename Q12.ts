// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name

let friends : string[] = ["Noor" , "Alishba" , "Aiman"];

let mmsg = "Assalam o alaikum How are You ?"

for (let i= 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
    console.log(friends[i]+" "+mmsg)
    
}
